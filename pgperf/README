This is the source code for a slightly hacked version of the GNU `gperf'
program, for generating perfect hash tables useful in quickly looking up
keywords.  Pavel hacked the source to add a `-I' flag that makes the generated
hash table case-insensitive; this was required in order to use it for the MOO
programming language.

The Makefile here still creates an executable named `gperf', but Pavel uses it
under the name `pgperf' in the MOO Makefile.  If you ever try to change the set
of keywords in the MOO, you'll need a working version of this program in order
to recreate the `keywords.c' file from `keywords.gperf'.
